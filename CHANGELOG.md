## [6.1.0] - 2023-11-14

### Added

- Add support for Assistants, Threads, Messages and Runs. Thank you [@Haegin](https://github.com/Haegin) for the excellent work on this PR, and many reviewers for their contributions!

## [6.0.1] - 2023-11-07

### Fix

- Gracefully handle the case where an HTTP error response may not have valid JSON in its body. Thank you [@atesgoral](https://github.com/atesgoral)!

## [6.0.0] - 2023-11-06

### Added

- [BREAKING] HTTP errors will now be raised by ruby-openai as Faraday:Errors, including when streaming! Implemented by [@atesgoral](https://github.com/atesgoral)
- [BREAKING] Switch from legacy Finetunes to the new Fine-tune-jobs endpoints. Implemented by [@lancecarlson](https://github.com/lancecarlson)
- [BREAKING] Remove deprecated Completions endpoints - use Chat instead.

### Fixed

- [BREAKING] Fix issue where :stream parameters were replaced by a boolean in the client application. Thanks to [@martinjaimem](https://github.com/martinjaimem), [@vickymadrid03](https://github.com/vickymadrid03) and [@nicastelo](https://github.com/nicastelo) for spotting and fixing this issue.

## [5.2.0] - 2023-10-30

### Fixed

- Added more spec-compliant SSE parsing: see here https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation
- Fixes issue where OpenAI or an intermediary returns only partial JSON per chunk of streamed data
- Huge thanks to [@atesgoral](https://github.com/atesgoral) for this important fix!

## [5.1.0] - 2023-08-20

### Added

- Added rough_token_count to estimate tokens in a string according to OpenAI's "rules of thumb". Thank you to [@jamiemccarthy](https://github.com/jamiemccarthy) for the idea and implementation!

## [5.0.0] - 2023-08-14

### Added

- Support multi-tenant use of the gem! Each client now holds its own config, so you can create unlimited clients in the same project, for example to Azure and OpenAI, or for different headers, access keys, etc.
- [BREAKING-ish] This change should only break your usage of ruby-openai if you are directly calling class methods like `OpenAI::Client.get` for some reason, as they are now instance methods. Normal usage of the gem should be unaffected, just you can make new clients and they'll keep their own config if you want, overriding the global config.
- Huge thanks to [@petergoldstein](https://github.com/petergoldstein) for his original work on this, [@cthulhu](https://github.com/cthulhu) for testing and many others for reviews and suggestions.

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Move audio related method to Audio model from Client model. You will need to update your code to handle this change, changing `client.translate` to `client.audio.translate` and `client.transcribe` to `client.audio.transcribe`.

## [4.3.2] - 2023-08-14

### Fixed

- Don't overwrite config extra-headers when making a client without different ones. Thanks to [@swistaczek](https://github.com/swistaczek) for raising this!
- Include extra-headers for Azure requests.

## [4.3.1] - 2023-08-13

- Add the ability to stream Chat responses from the API! Thanks to everyone who requested this and made suggestions.
- Added instructions for streaming to the README.

### Changed

- Switch HTTP library from HTTParty to Faraday to allow streaming and future feature and performance improvements.
- [BREAKING] Endpoints now return JSON rather than HTTParty objects. You will need to update your code to handle this change, changing `JSON.parse(response.body)["key"]` and `response.parsed_response["key"]` to just `response["key"]`.

## [3.7.0] - 2023-03-25
